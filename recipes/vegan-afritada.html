            A veganized version of a popular Filipino dish made from vegan chicken
            stewed with tomato sauce and vegetables.
          </h2>
          <p>
            It is packed with flavor, SO easy to make, and naturally gluten-free! Plus
            it tastes just like the classic dish, only vegan.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is perfect for meal prep or for serving a large crowd and is best
            served alongside rice.

      </ul>
      
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the soy curls. Mix the vegan chicken broth paste into a small
          pot with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Add the
          soy curls into the pot and use a spoon to mix and make sure that every
          piece is covered with water. Set aside and allow the soy curls to
          rehydrate for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the meantime, set a large pot over medium heat and add in the oil.
          Once heated, add in the bay leaves and cook for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the onions and garlic, and continue cooking until the garlic is
          fragrant the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes. Add in the bell
          peppers and vegan hot dogs, and cook for 3 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, add in the carrots and potatoes. Mix until well combined an allow
          this to cook for 4 minutes, mixing often. The carrots and potatoes
          should be slightly softened but not cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the tomato sauce, peas, and the soy curls with the broth. Mix until
          everything is combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the remaining ⅓ cup of water into the tomato sauce can, swirl it
          around to get any remaining sauce and pour that all into the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover, and simmer on medium low until the carrots and tomatoes are
          cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper to taste. We added a
          lot of black pepper as it is one of our favorite spices!
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from heat and cool before serving. You can remove the bay leaves
          or just eat around them. Serve with rice and enjoy!
        </li>
